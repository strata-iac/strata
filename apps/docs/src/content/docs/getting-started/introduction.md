title: Introduction
description: What Strata is, why self-host your Pulumi backend, and what's included.
---

Strata is a self-hosted backend for [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), the infrastructure-as-code platform. It implements the Pulumi Service API so that the standard Pulumi CLI works against it without modification — `pulumi login`, `pulumi stack init`, `pulumi up`, `pulumi destroy`, state import/export, secret encryption, and more.

## Why Self-Host?

Pulumi Cloud is the default backend for managing state, secrets, and collaboration. For teams that need to keep infrastructure state within their own network boundary — whether for compliance, data sovereignty, or cost — Strata provides a drop-in replacement.

- **Data sovereignty** — state and secrets never leave your infrastructure
- **No vendor dependency** — run on your own PostgreSQL and S3-compatible storage
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — organization-scoped access control with role-based permissions
- **Horizontal scaling** — add replicas behind a load balancer with zero configuration changes

## What Works

Strata implements the Pulumi Service API surface that the CLI uses:
